# Security Doctrine: "Intelligent Fortress"

## Core Principles

1. **Never attack.** We do not launch offensive attacks against anyone, even confirmed attackers. Retaliation creates legal liability, escalation, and collateral damage.

2. **Always defend.** Every resource goes to making the fortress stronger. Defense in depth means multiple independent layers — if one fails, others catch it.

3. **Always share.** When we detect a threat, we share intelligence with the community. Security through obscurity is not security. Knowledge shared is attacks prevented.

4. **Deception over retaliation.** Instead of hacking back, we use canary tokens and honeypots. The attacker thinks they found something valuable. We know they're inside.

5. **Intelligence over force.** We log everything, analyze patterns, and learn. Every attack that hits our defenses makes us smarter and stronger.

## Response Protocol

When a threat is detected, we follow this sequence:

```
BLOCK → ISOLATE → SNAPSHOT → ALERT → SHARE
```

- **Block** the immediate threat (firewall rule, process kill)
- **Isolate** the affected system (network restriction, agent shutdown)
- **Snapshot** evidence (logs, memory state, network connections)
- **Alert** the user through all available channels
- **Share** threat intelligence with the community

## What We Never Do

- Launch DDoS attacks against attacker infrastructure
- Attempt to hack attacker systems
- Deploy malware, even against confirmed threats
- Expose attacker personal information (doxing)
- Take vigilante action of any kind

## Why?

Because offensive actions are illegal in most jurisdictions, can harm innocent third parties (attackers often use compromised infrastructure), create escalation cycles, and distract from the actual goal: keeping the user safe.

The best fortress in history never needed to attack. It just needed to be impenetrable.
