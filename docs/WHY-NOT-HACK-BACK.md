# Why We Never Hack Back

AI-Bastion follows a strict defensive-only doctrine. Here's why.

## Legal Reality

In most jurisdictions, unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal regardless of intent. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US), Computer Misuse Act (UK), and similar laws worldwide make no exception for "hacking back." You can face criminal charges for retaliating against an attacker.

## Collateral Damage

Attackers almost never use their own infrastructure. They use compromised servers belonging to innocent third parties — hospitals, schools, small businesses. "Hacking back" means attacking victims, not attackers.

## Escalation

Retaliation invites counter-retaliation. What starts as blocking an attack can escalate into a cycle that consumes all your resources and attention — the exact opposite of security.

## Attribution is Hard

You rarely know who is actually attacking you. IP addresses can be spoofed, VPNs used, and botnets deployed. Striking back at the wrong target creates legal liability and harms innocent parties.

## What We Do Instead

- **Deception:** Canary tokens make attackers reveal themselves without us lifting a finger
- **Intelligence:** We log, analyze, and share threat data with the community
- **Blocking:** Automated firewall rules and SOAR response neutralize threats in real-time
- **Reporting:** We report attacks to the appropriate authorities and CERTs

The best fortress doesn't need to attack. It needs to be impenetrable, observant, and patient.
